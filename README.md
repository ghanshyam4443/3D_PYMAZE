🌀 3D Python Maze Solver
🎮 A 3D Maze Generator & Solver built using Python and Pygame/OpenGL!
Welcome to 3D Python Maze, a fun and interactive project where I combined creativity with algorithms to generate and solve mazes in a 3D visual space using Python.

📌 Features
🔁 Random Maze Generation – Dynamic generation of solvable mazes.

👀 3D Visualization – Realistic maze navigation using 3D rendering (via Pygame or PyOpenGL).

🧠 Maze Solving Algorithm – Implements popular solving algorithms like DFS or BFS.

🎮 First-Person Movement – Navigate the maze from a player’s perspective.

🌌 Custom Themes – Ability to customize walls, floor, and lighting.

🧠 Tech Stack
Python 3

Pygame or PyOpenGL for rendering

NumPy for grid management

Algorithms: Depth-First Search / Breadth-First Search for solving
